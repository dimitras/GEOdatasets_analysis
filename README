GEO analysis

Retrieve GEO datasets to check the variability of expression of a key genes list for the COX pathway.

An R source commands-set for parsing GSE_family.soft files and creating a custom csv table with a 'GSM-expression value' pair per prob. 
Used the GEOquery lib written in R (http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/moac/people/students/peter_cock/r/geo). 

Embodied script to run R source by command line (without having to get in the R environment) by passing through arguments.
