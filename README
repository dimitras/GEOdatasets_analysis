GEO analysis

All experiments retrieved from GEO were carried out under the same conditions. The conditions would include how the samples were treated as well as the platform and protocol used to perform the microarray.

### PART 1 ###

Retrieve GEO datasets to check the variability of expression of a key genes list for the COX pathway.

- An R source commands-set for parsing GSE_family.soft files and creating a custom csv table with a 'GSM-expression value' pair per prob. 
- Used the GEOquery lib written in R (http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/moac/people/students/peter_cock/r/geo). 
- Embodied script to run R source by command line (without having to get in the R environment) by passing through arguments.


### PART 2 ###

Find the COX pathway genes through the datasets (GSE as source files).

- Parse GSM tables with ruby script to find and count the existence of COX pathway genes. 
- Export these genes with their expression values for all samples.
- Barplot in R, the average expression and standard error per experiment and by gene (pending).


### PART 3 ###

Find the COX pathway genes through the PCLs (same datasets but CEL as source files) 

- The probe-ids-like in the PCLs are the entrez ids with the probe_id suffix "at".
- R script to locate the COX genes among the csv datasets (PCL files converted to csv).
- Barplot in R, the average expression and standard error per experiment and by gene (pending).

### PART 4 ###

Retrieve genetic data from hapmap by correil id.
