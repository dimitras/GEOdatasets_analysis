COX expression analysis

All experiments retrieved from GEO were carried out under the same conditions. The conditions would include how the samples were treated as well as the platform and protocol used to perform the microarray.

### PART 1 ###

Retrieve GEO datasets to check the variability of expression of a key genes list for the COX pathway.

- An R source commands-set for parsing GSE_family.soft files and creating a custom csv table with a 'GSM-expression value' pair per prob. 
- Used the GEOquery lib written in R (http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/moac/people/students/peter_cock/r/geo). 
- Embodied script to run R source by command line (without having to get in the R environment) by passing through arguments.


### PART 2 ###

Find the COX pathway genes through the datasets (GSE as source files).

- Parse GSM tables with ruby script to find and count the existence of COX pathway genes. 
- Export these genes with their expression values for all samples.
- Barplot in R, the average expression and standard error per experiment and by gene (pending).


### PART 3 ###

Retrieve CEL files for GEO datasets from GEO to process and RMA normalize the Affy CEL files.

- Run Princeton's script for all experiments and get the PCL files in format: Entrezid_at, expression values for all samples.


### PART 4 ###

Find the COX pathway genes through the PCLs (same datasets but CEL as source files as mentioned in step 3).

- The probe-ids-like in the PCLs are the entrez ids with the probe_id suffix "at".
- R script to locate the COX genes among the csv datasets (PCL files converted to csv first).
- Barplot in R, the average expression and standard error per experiment and by gene (pending). Note that the x axis in the plots are the genes (entrez ids).


### PART 5 ###

Retrieve genetic data from hapmap by correil id.

- Link the GM ids (GEO sample ids) with the coriell ids (Hapmap sample ids) with ruby script.
- Retrieve the respective genotypes for these coriell ids from hapmap. Parse all chromosomes in the consensus for each sample set (CEU, JPT, YRI, CHB) and also cross validate with the inconsistencies.
- filter the genetic data with 1) 5% variance, 2) only parents
- specify in genome 100KB +- from  transcription start site (not sure what this is yet..)


### PART 6 ###

Genetics analysis for COX expression.

- Analysis with Genetic Power Calculator.
- Whole genome association analysis plink toolset.
