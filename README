GEO analysis


### PART 1 ###

Retrieve GEO datasets to check the variability of expression of a key genes list for the COX pathway.

- An R source commands-set for parsing GSE_family.soft files and creating a custom csv table with a 'GSM-expression value' pair per prob. 
- Used the GEOquery lib written in R (http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/moac/people/students/peter_cock/r/geo). 
- Embodied script to run R source by command line (without having to get in the R environment) by passing through arguments.


### PART 2 ###

Find the COX pathway genes through the datasets.

- Parse GSM tables with ruby script to find and count the existence of COX pathway genes. 
- Export these genes with their expression values for all samples.
